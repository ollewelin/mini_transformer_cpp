OK basic vector question When I set up a vector with its size I want I use a for loop and in the for loop I have vector.pushback(0.0);operation I guess this is another way you show here to set up the size and fill the 2D vector with 0.0 here : // Constructor
PositionalEncoding::PositionalEncoding(int max_len, int d_model) {
    pos_encoding = std::vector<std::vector<float>>(max_len, std::vector<float>(d_model, 0.0)); I guess when you write this you set the 2D inner vector size to d_model filled with float 0.0 then this inner vector fill the outer dimentions with size max_len (with the inner 1D vector of size d_model with scalers of 0.0 is that correct and is that eqvivalen to you two loops in a serie where I first create a dummy 1D vector filled with 0.0 whit use pushback and then make another for loop itterate max_len where I pushback this 1D dummy vector
